If I had to define myself I would say that Iâ€™m someone extremely curious. I like learning about almost everything. I enjoy going to tech events and meetups.

I love travelling. Actually, after getting my engineering degree I quit my job and decided to travel around Asia for a year.

In my spare time I practice [WingTsun](https://iwtoa.com.ar/) which is a martial art (maybe you heard about Ip man or Bruce Lee). I enjoy playing music and this year I started doing calisthenics.

Throughout my career, I have worked on a wide range of projects from financial products to mobile games and that is one of the things I like the most; being able to work in different scenarios and people with different backgrounds.
